# Ammo Tracker

Tired of keeping track of how many arrows, bolts, etc. you used during the combat? Ammo Tracker does that for you and lets you automatically recover the ammunition used.

*Note: Ammo is tracked only during an encounter.*
*Note2: This module is inspired by [RC Spent/Recoverable Ammo Tracker](https://github.com/rcebulko/foundryvtt-ammo-tracker)*
